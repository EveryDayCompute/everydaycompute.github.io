On many websites there are buttons to share an article to other sites or to chat services. This is done in the browser either by linking to the website and passing parameters about the post to share or a protocol handler might be used when there is an actual application installed. In the case of email for mailto links it is really any mail that has it registered. We are going to look at different sites dialogs and how the link is constructed.

To make a button for it there are a few ways where one is JavaScript that runs when a button is pressed and opens a popup and the other is a simple link. I always recommend a simple link as is way more accessible and good if someone uses multi account containers or are not using JavaScript on your website.

Here is a long list of different found URLs for different sites that allow sharing and some of the details of how they work.

## Types of parameters
Below is a table of types of parameters you might find inside a share dialog URL. 

type | explanation
|:-:|
body | The body of the post can be set with this and might include URLs
title | Sets the title of the post the user makes
enum | Has a fixed set of values it must be set to
csv | Comma separated values usually used for tags
URL | An URL to be linked to in the post

Some of them might be required even to they do not seem to be and some of them are hard to test.

## Mastodon
Mastodon is the toughest one to really get working as there are many instances and you cannot know what instance the user is on without asking the. You can look at the source of this site in order to know how it is done here and try out the button for yourself.

## Twitter

## Notes
Not all sites have share dialogs such as Bsky does not have one unless that has changed and cohost I have not been able to confirm. Some also have extremely broken ones that sort of work but not really such as wordpress with the url parameter that tries to embed a post somehow  
https://wordpress.com/post/?url=https://everydaycompute.github.io/2023/11/22/share-buttons.html
If you make your own social media site or anything like it I do recommend making your own dialog like that.

There are also some browser addons that add buttons with share dialogs to every website and I even made my own that adds a mastodon share button to every website.

I found quite a few share buttons here if you do not care about making your own

Be very sure that you have your meta tags like open graph and others set up correctly since it is very useful for previews on other sites to work correctly. [Here is an article I wrote about that](https://everydaycompute.github.io/2023/11/17/open-graph-oembed-order.html) and also make sure random robots can read the `robots.txt` for preview it since they do obey it typically

I would be extremely surprised if someone somehow managed to press all the buttons below
